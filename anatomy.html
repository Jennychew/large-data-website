			<h3>Anatomy of a Hummingbird</h3>
			<p>Hummingbirds vary in weight anywhere from 2 to 20 grams, which can be compared to the weight of a small piece of jewelry, or small coin. A tiny frame equals small eggs, which are about the size of a pea, while their nest is the size of a walnut!
 The mouth of a hummingbird is quite unique. The bill measures about 15-20 mm in length and can open to just about 1cm wide, which is comparable to the width of a fettuccine noodle. One common misconception is that the bill is used as a straw to slurp up nectar. This is not true; in fact the hummingbird tongue is used to ingest nectar in the way a dog or cat drinks water (about 12 slurps per second).
 The digestive system of hummingbirds is made up of over eight organs which help the hummingbirds’ metabolism to run efficiently.

		  They can also store up to 45% of fat in their livers around the time of migration, which explains their ability to expend such large amounts of energy.
		 Hummingbirds to some extent have the largest heart of all animals. Their heart is 2.5% of their weight. 250 beats per minute is their average heart rate, which increases to about 1,220 beats per minute in flight. 			</p>

         <p>The muscular system is one of the most important – especially the chest and wing muscles that allow them to fly. These muscles make up a larger portion of their weight – about 10% more than other flying birds. Unlike other birds, a hummingbirds elbows and wrists bones are fused together. However, their shoulder has a motion of 180 degrees. Because of this motion a hummingbirds wings are no doubt a powerhouse!
 Hummingbirds in flight are often compared to that of a helicopter. The only difference is a helicopters propeller action which moves in a circular motion continuously, while a hummingbirds wings move backward and forward while switching angles – somewhat like a figure 8 motion. This motion allows them to remain balanced in flight. More so, the chest muscles (over a 1/3 of their body mass) helps to power its wings.

			<h3>Description</h3>
			<p>
			The legs of a ruby-throated hummingbird are too short for it to walk or hop, but it can shuffle along a perch. When it comes time to scratch its head or neck, the hummingbird raises its foot over its wing to scratch.
			
			The ruby-throated hummingbird is a tiny bird with an iridescent green back. The male can be distinguished from the female by its iridescent red throat (the femaleâ€™s throat is white). The female is also larger than the male and has three white tips on its tail feathers.

			<h3>Food</h3>
			<p>
			Ruby-throated hummingbirds eat flower nectar, small insects and spiders, tree sap, and will eat at hummingbird feeders. It hovers at flowers to feed, and can beat its wings 55-75 times per second!
			
			Ruby-throated hummingbirds show preference to feeder locations but not to feeder colours. They also catch insects in flight, pluck them from leaves, and pluck spiders from their webs.

Did you know there are between 328-340 hummingbird species! Most species can be found in tropical climates, such as Mexico. However, they can also be found from far south as Argentina to as far north as Alaska. So how can the bodies of these little creatures conform to various climates and environments? To answer this question, we need to learn more about the hummingbird anatomy.

We will look at the Ruby-Throat species anatomy because of its prevalence here in the US. Primarily the Ruby-Throat anatomy is like most birds, although there are variations in the size of their parts/structures, etc.

Hummingbirds vary in weight anywhere from 2 to 20 grams, which can be compared to the weight of a small piece of jewelry, or small coin. A tiny frame equals small eggs, which are about the size of a pea, while their nest is the size of a walnut!
 
The mouth of a hummingbird is quite unique. The bill measures about 15-20 mm in length and can open to just about 1cm wide, which is comparable to the width of a fettuccine noodle. One common misconception is that the bill is used as a straw to slurp up nectar. This is not true; in fact the hummingbird tongue is used to ingest nectar in the way a dog or cat drinks water (about 12 slurps per second).
 
The digestive system of hummingbirds is made up of over eight organs which help the hummingbirdsâ€™ metabolism to run efficiently. They can also store up to 45% of fat in their livers around the time of migration, which explains their ability to expend such large amounts of energy.
